The changes I made to the code provided:

1. I implimented a score and displayed it
2. I implimented a live or ship keeping counter, and displayed it using ships
3. I implimented a count of the number of aliens killed, and displayed implimented

Some other things I put in for fun:
4. A ray gun battery mechanic, the ship may only shoot if it has enough charge
5. A background and cosmetic changes to the icons
6. A level keeping counter
7. The Aliens' speed (and the ray gun recharge) increases exponentially every level
8. A game clock that tracks how long the game has been played
9. on-screen messages that display "ship hit" and "game over"
10. Adjusted the arena to allow displays of the above statistics on the side of the screen
