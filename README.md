Welcome to my Github!

It's still a work in progress. I figured that rather than just saving files on my computer, 
I would get into the habit of uploading class work, personal projects, and the like
to github to get into the habit.

In this repository, you wil find my Alien Game, a project from Software 101
My game won second place in the class (Thank you Sharon!), mostly due to a few feaures I
inlcuded for fun, such as a resource meter, power-ups, and finely tuning the colors and 
aesthetic presentation of the program as a whole.

As with all of my projects, I can never impliment all of the features I dream to, so it is a 
work in progress.
